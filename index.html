    <h1>Angular Defect Orientation Detection from B-scans</h1>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1px;">Problem Description</h2>
    <section>
        <p>Defects in building envelopes present unique challenges for GPR diagnostics. This is
        primarily due to the low permittivity contrasts between the envelope and defect materials, as 
        well as the irregular shapes of the defects. The minimal contrast in permittivity between envelope materials 
        (such as PVC and plywood) and defect materials (typically trapped air) results in weak reflections that are often 
        difficult to interpret. Additionally, the irregular geometries of defects produce 
        erratic patterns in radargrams, making them hard to classify reliably.
            
        This study investigates the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for 
        detecting such defects. To this end, a controlled experiment is designed in which 
        an isosceles triangular defect is rotated within a building envelope. For each 
        orientation, the corresponding GPR B-scan of the wall section is simulated using 
        an FDTD solver (GPRMax). A convolutional regression model is then employed to 
        predict the angle of orientation of the defect from the resulting radargrams.</p>
    </section>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: -5px;">Data</h2>

    As seen in Figure 1 illustration, the change in orientation of the defect results in continuous shifts in the B-scan signal, 
    until the incoming signals are aligned with one of the corners in the triangle. However, the signals disappear abruptly when
    the corner of the defect is aligned towards the incoming signal.

        <figcaption style = "width: 150%; display: block;"><b>Figure 1</b>: A continuous shift is observed with a change in orientation, which makes the scans 
        more interpretable.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    This represents a challenge for any model attempting to predict the orientation of the defect, since this means
    that the distribution of the B-scans is not smooth and continuous concerning the angle of orientation.

        <figcaption style = "width: 150%; display: block;"><b>Figure 2</b>: Given the symmetry of the triangular shape of the defect, different orientations lead to very similar scans.
                    This poses a challenge in predicting the orientation of the defect. </figcaption>
    </figure>

Moreover, the symmetrical nature of the shape means that defects at very different orientations can lead to very similar signals.
As seen in Figure 2, the defect angles 140 and 280 have very similar signals, so do 0 and 220, and 300 and 60.

    </div>

Reduced-dimensional projection of the B-scans maintains this pattern. Clusters of points corresponding 
to similar defect angles lie close to each other, however, this is only a local trend, covering only segments
of possible defect angles. Dissimilar angles that produce similar scans are closer together in the reduced 
embedding (see 142 and 281 defect angles). 
    
    <h2>Model</h2>
    A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model specifically designed for processing structured grid data,
    such as images. CNNs are particularly effective for tasks like image classification, object detection, and regression problems 
    involving spatial data. A convolutional regressor with the following architecture is used to predict the defect angle from the B-scan:

    <h2>Analysis and Results</h2>

    Different train-test splits are subsequently used to evaluate the model's performance. 
    
    <h3> Random Split</h3>
    The dataset is randomly split into an 80-20 ratio. The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%.

                    This poses a challenge in predicting the orientation of the defect. </figcaption>
    </figure>

    As seen in Figure 5, the model can predict the defect angle with a percent root mean squared error of of 6.83%. (how manny 
    in degrees?)

    <h3> Interpolation Split</h3>
    To further investigate model performance on an unseen range of orientations, a conditional split is used.
